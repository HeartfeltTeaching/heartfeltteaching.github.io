<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students often use arguing, whining and complaining to avoid consequences. When
        students utilize this avoidance tactic, they invite adults into arguments. Teachers engage hoping that rationalizing with them 
        will gain compliance. Unfortunately, this exchange only turns into a power struggle that
        halts instruction. If the consequence of this exchange results in the student being ejected from the classroom,
        then the student has succeeded in their original intent of avoiding work. If the student did not get what they
        wanted, then the student might provoke the teacher by drawing a line and picking a fight. Not only
        is engaging in the arguing ineffective but teachers find it hard to keep calm in situations where their authority is being
        challenged. Teachers might be provoked enough to counter with an inappropriate reaction. If the teacher loses self-control,
        they fail to be the proper role model they are intending to be. Ultimately, the dignity of the educator must
        remain intact. There is a positive impact when an adult emerges as a healthy authority figure. Maintaining your
        leadership can be accomplished by not engaging with the student. L&L calls this strategy going "<i>brain dead<i>" and using a
        rehearsed one-liner to respond to arguing, like: "<i>I know<i>" or "<i>I care too much to argue."<i> When the teacher refrains from joining the
        fight and countering with threats, they are calm enough to remain effective.</span></p>
