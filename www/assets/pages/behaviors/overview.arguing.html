Students often use arguing, whining and complaining to avoid consequences. When students employ this avoidance tactic, they invite adults into arguments. Teachers engage hoping that the logic and wisdom they share will gain compliance. Unfortunately, this exchange only turns into a power struggle that halts instruction. If the consequence of this exchange results in the student being ejected from the classroom, then the student has succeeded in their original intent of avoiding work. If the student did not get what he wanted, then the student might provoke the teacher by drawing a line in the sand and picking a fight. Not only is this ineffective but teachers find it hard to keep calm in situations where their authority is being challenged. Teachers sometimes will counter with an inappropriate reaction. If the teacher loses self-control, they fail to be the proper role model they are intending to be. Ultimately, the dignity of the educator must remain intact.  There is a positive impact when the adult endures as a healthy authority figure.  Love and Logic encourages teachers to maintain their leadership by simply going “brain dead” and using a rehearsed one-liner like: “I know” or “I care too much to argue.”  When the teacher refrains from joining the fight and countering with threats, they are calm enough to remain effective.
