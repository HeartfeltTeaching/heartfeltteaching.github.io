    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go "<i>Brain Dead<i>"- The less our lips move, the more effective we become. Resisting the
        urge to counter with a comeback, makes it easier to avoid diving into pointless quarrels. Listening, not arguing
        is the best way to shift a mindset.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calmly repeat a Love and Logic one-liner- When we remember to calmly repeat the very
        same thing&hellip; regardless of what our students say&hellip; we starve them of argument fuel. Eventually, they
        will quit complaining. Repeat the same one-liner every time your student tries to argue. Below are examples of
        some favorite one-liners:
        <ul>
            <li>"<i>I care too much to argue.<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>I know.<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>What did I say?<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>Thank you for sharing.<i>"&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use an Empathetic Statement</strong> - Empathy allows you to hold students accountable without losing
        their respect. Examples of empathetic statements:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>"<i>What a Bummer<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>I can&rsquo;t imagine how bad that feels<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>I care too much to argue.<i>" </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Encourage Thinking</strong> - Thinking prompts students to begin thinking about possible solutions and
        their likely consequences.
        <ul>
            <li>"<i>What do you think I am thinking?<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>What would you like to see happen?<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>Would you like to hear what other students have tried?<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>Some students do A, some do B.<i>"</li>
            <li>"<i>What do you think will work best for you?<i>"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
