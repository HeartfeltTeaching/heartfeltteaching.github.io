    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go "Brain Dead"- The less our lips move, the more effective we become. Resisting the
        urge to counter with a comeback, makes it easier to avoid diving into pointless quarrels. Listening, not arguing
        is the best way to shift a mindset.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calmly repeat a Love and Logic One Liner- When we remember to calmly repeat the very
        same thing&hellip; regardless of what our students say&hellip; we starve them of argument fuel. Eventually, they
        will quit complaining. Repeat the same One Liner every time your student tries to argue. Below are examples of
        some favorite one liners:
        <ul>
            <li>"I care too much to argue."</li>
            <li>"I know."</li>
            <li>"What did I say?"</li>
            <li>"Thank you for sharing."&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use an Empathetic Statement</strong> - Empathy allows you to hold students accountable without losing
        their respect. Examples of empathetic statements:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>"What a Bummer"</li>
            <li>"I can&rsquo;t imagine how bad that feels"</li>
            <li>"I care too much to argue" </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Encourage Thinking</strong> - Thinking prompts students to begin thinking about possible solutions and
        their likely consequences.
        <ul>
            <li>"What do you think I am thinking?"</li>
            <li>"What would you like to see happen?"</li>
            <li>"Would you like to hear what other students have tried?"</li>
            <li>"Some students do A, some do B."</li>
            <li>"What do you think will work best for you?"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
