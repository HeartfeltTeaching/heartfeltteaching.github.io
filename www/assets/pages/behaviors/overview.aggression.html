<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggressive behaviors are demonstrated in a variety of ways
        in the classroom setting. They can comprise of fights and arguments toward students, or verbal aggression such
        as profanity and arguing toward teachers. They can refuse to cooperate in class activities, or damage and use
        materials to create disruptive sounds and noises. Aggressive behaviors may play a part in individual differences
        in emotional regulation. Since educators are foundation builders, they have an opportunity to create a
        high-achieving school and classroom culture. The foundation of all successful work with students involves
        creating a classroom culture based on positive relationships. The first step in the process when struggling with
        a difficult student is to build positive relationships. Initiating steps toward a more positive child-teacher
        relationship, creates an overall positive school environment. Learning a little about a student&rsquo;s
        interests and personality helps to foster a connection. Once those relationships are established, particularly
        with difficult students, maintaining compliance is easier. Establish a foundation filled with empathy. This is
        the key to displaying love and understanding before holding students firmly accountable for their actions.
        Finally, structure acceptable choices and enforceable statements. Once limits are set and paired with
        enforceable statements, enjoy the benefit of always being able to follow through on your word. When we say,
    </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I listen to students who allow me to teach,"</span></em><span
        style="font-weight: 400;"> we are providing limits for healthy relationships.. Once we set enforceable
        statements, we dramatically increase the odds that our students will listen.</span></p>
