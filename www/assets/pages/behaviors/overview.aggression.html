<p>Educators are most familiar with students displaying aggressive behaviors in the classroom setting. These typical behaviors can be exhibited as physical and verbal aggression toward classmates (fighting and arguments), verbal aggression toward teachers (profanity, arguing), refusing to cooperate in class activities, and damaging or using materials to create disruptive sounds and noises. Aggressive behaviors may play a part in individual differences in emotional regulation. Luckily, educators are foundation builders, they create a high-achieving school and classroom culture. The foundation of all successful work with students involves creating a classroom culture based on positive relationships. The first step in the process when struggling with a difficult student or class is to build positive relationships. Teachers initiate steps toward a more positive child-teacher relationship to create an overall positive school environment. Learning a little about studentâ€™s interests and personality helps to foster a connection between students and teachers. Once those relationships are established, particularly with difficult students, maintaining compliance is easier. Next, educators lay a strong foundation filled with empathy, which is the key of displaying love and understanding before holding students firmly accountable for their actions. Finally, educators structure acceptable choices and enforceable statements. Once limits are set and paired with enforceable statements, educators can enjoy the benefit of always being able to follow through on their word. When we say, "I listen to students who allow me to teach," we are setting the stage for providing that it is wise to listen. Once we set enforceable statements, we dramatically increase the odds that our students will listen.</p>
