<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold kids accountable to build responsibility and self-concept. Ask them questions to
        generate thinking. This sends a powerful message that their noncompliance is not the teacher's problem,
        and that there is a consequence the student will eventually face. Asking them questions prompts them to think
        through their problems and reflect on their behavior</span><strong>. Questions include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you do about this problem? </span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you like to see happen?</span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you suppose this will work out?</span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a scale of 1-5, how good of a decision do you
                think this is?</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think I think about that?</span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like to hear what other kids have
                tried?</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some kids do A, some B. What do you think will
                work best for you?</span></em></li>
</ul>
