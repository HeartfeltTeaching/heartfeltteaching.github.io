<h2>Accountability</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold kids accountable to build responsibility and self-concept. Ask them questions to
        generate thinking. This sends a powerful message that their noncompliance is not the teacher's problem, and that
        there is a consequence the student will eventually face. Asking them questions prompts them to think through
        their problems and reflect on their behavior</span><strong>. Questions include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you do about this problem? </span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you like to see happen?</span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you suppose this will work out?</span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a scale of 1-5, how good of a decision do you
                think this is?</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think I think about that?</span></em>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like to hear what other kids have
                tried?</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some kids do A, some B. What do you think will
                work best for you?</span></em></li>
</ul>

<br />

<h2>Enforceable Statements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting and enforcing reasonable limits without raising your voice helps all to enjoy
        a predictable and consistent learning environment. Use enforceable statements by describing what you are willing
        to do or allow. Don't tell kids how to run their lives. Instead tell them how you are going to run yours.</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I will be glad to listen when your voice sounds
                as calm as mine."</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I will start when everyone is
                seated."</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I listen to students who raise their
                hands."</span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I will discuss this when I feel respect is
                shown." </span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I allow students to work in groups as long as the
                noise level remains soft."</span></em></li>
</ul>

<br />

<h2>Delay Consequences</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delaying the consequences gives you time to calm down, clear your head, and consult
        with others as needed. Not only does this buy you time, it will also signal that you are still in
        control.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Oh no. This is sad. I'm going to have to do something about this. But not
                now, later. Try not to worry about it."</span></em></li>
    <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm going to have to address this. We'll talk later." </span></em></li>
</ul>

<br />

<h2>Avoid a Power Struggle</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopt a "consultative" type of leadership in the classroom. Practice providing
        students with multiple opportunities to make small choices. Instead of telling children what to do, encourage
        them to make decisions for themselves. Providing choices, not only helps children think for themselves, in many
        cases it may also motivate them. Be sure to give choices BEFORE resistance and not after.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Would you rather do the even problems or the odd?"</span></em></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What would be best for you, math work or silent work first?"</span></li>
    <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What would help you the most, to work with a partner or
                independently?</span></em></li>
</ul>
