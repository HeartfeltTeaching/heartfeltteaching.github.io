    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use very few words- Using fewer words shows your
            students that you are not getting drawn into their trap for a battle.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow through with a consequence that is appropriate
            for you and your classroom.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive your statements with empathy- offer kind words
            before delivering a consequence to build a respectful relationship with your students</span></li>
