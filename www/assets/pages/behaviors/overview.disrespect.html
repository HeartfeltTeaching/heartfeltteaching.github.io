<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disruptive behaviors in the classroom have evolved from a relatively minor concern to a
        significant reality. In truth, students that are disrespectful need an emotionally healthy environment with a teacher 
        who will set the tone and model positive interactions. When young people can be held accountable in a respectful way, 
        students will develop trust in their teachers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, teachers engage in power struggles with students. Children
        understand they do not have much control in the classroom, therefore disrespecting teachers becomes a way to win over control.
        They operate with the belief that treating authority figures with scorn will help them win the power struggle. When 
        students are offered a choice instead of making a demand, the chances of a power struggle dramatically reduce. 
        Offering choices is a powerful way to curtail the chance of the student acting out in a disrespectful manner. 
        When commands and demands are given, it leaves the student with only one way to win, the power struggle. However, 
        when giving a range of choices, students are provided with opportunities to choose wisely. </span></p>
