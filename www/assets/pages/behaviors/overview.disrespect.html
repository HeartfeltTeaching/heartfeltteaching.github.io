Disruptive behaviors among youth has evolved from a relatively minor concern to a significant reality. Students that are disrespectful require a nurturing environment and social and emotional competencies through modeling and instruction. When young people are explicitly shown these skills, given opportunities to practice, and receive supportive feedback, dramatic improvements are often demonstrated in variety of areas. Students must be given opportunities to observe and practice problem-solving skills. These opportunities enable adults to teach competencies through modeling, instruction, and coaching.

It is often the case that educators engage in power struggles with students. Children understand they do not have much control in the classroom, therefore whining becomes important for students. They create the belief that whining will help them win the power struggle and will gain them control. When we offer our students a choice instead of making a demand, no power struggle ever begins, therefore we are reducing the chance of the student acting in a disrespectful manner. When we make a demand, we own the wise choice, leaving the student with only one way to win the power struggle- by making a foolish choice. Giving a range of choices, provides students with an endless opportunities to choose wisely.
