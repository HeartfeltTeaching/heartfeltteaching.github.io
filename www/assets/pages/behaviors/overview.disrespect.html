<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disruptive behaviors among youth have evolved from a relatively minor concern to a
        significant reality. Students that are disrespectful require a nurturing environment and social and emotional
        competencies through modeling and instruction. When young people are explicitly shown these skills, given
        opportunities to practice, and receive supportive feedback, dramatic improvements are often demonstrated in
        variety of areas. Students must be given opportunities to observe and practice problem-solving skills. These
        opportunities enable adults to teach competencies through modeling, instruction, and coaching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often the case that educators engage in power struggles with students. Children
        understand they do not have much control in the classroom, therefore whining becomes important for students.
        They create the belief that whining will help them win the power struggle and will gain them control. When you
        offer your students a choice instead of making a demand, no power struggle ever begins, therefore you are
        reducing the chance of the student acting in a disrespectful manner. When you make a demand, you own the wise
        choice, leaving the student with only one way to win the power struggle- by making a foolish choice. Giving a
        range of choices, provides students with an endless opportunities to choose wisely. </span></p>
