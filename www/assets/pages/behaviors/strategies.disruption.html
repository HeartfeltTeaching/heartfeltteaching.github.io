<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide choices with limits primarily as a preventative measure. It will be difficult
        to provide effective choices in the face of a disruption. During these times, our brains tend to go into fight
        or flight mode, and we can't think of the best choices. As such, the only choices that come to mind are
        threats.</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> "Settle down or go to the principal's
            office!"</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thinking of choices usually requires a calm mind, and
        usually happens when you are experiencing a high level of cooperation. That is the time to offer two options
        that are equally acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide choices before resistance happens. </span><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">Offering choices work better instead of giving a direct instruction to kids who have a
        history of noncompliance. Instead of saying, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Work with Joe on this
            project."</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ask your student, "</span><em><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">Would you rather work with Zach or Zoey on this project?" </span></em><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Make sure that either option will be acceptable to you. Do not offer a choice
        that will not make you happy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the student does not choose within a few
        seconds, choose for them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: </span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Would you rather&hellip;" </span></em></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What would be best for you&hellip;" </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Feel free to&hellip;" </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What would help you the most&hellip;" </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery time as a strategy- Sometimes a disruptive student simply needs to be
        someplace else&hellip; temporarily, so the rest of the class has an opportunity to learn and the disrupting
        student has an opportunity to become calm.</span></p>
