    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Give Choices</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Find ways for the child
            to gain an appropriate sense of control. Give </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lots of little choices

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phrases for giving choices:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Would you rather . . ."</span></em></li>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What would be best for you . . ." </span></em></li>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Feel free to . . ."</span></em></li>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What would help you the most . . ." </span></em></li>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Do you plan to . . ."</span></em></li>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Are you going to . . ."</span></em></li>

    <li><strong>Transfer the ownership of learning to student</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ask,
        </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"what will you do?"</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This
            question communicates volumes. First, that it is not the teacher's job to rescue a student. Second,
            the message being relayed is a confidence that the student has the capacity to solve their own problems.
        </span></li>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Deliver the consequence with a strong dose of empathy. </strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I can't imagine how bad you must feel. I had to give you a zero
                    because I never got your work. </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please let me
                    know how I can help. I believe in you."</span></em></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus on successes and gifts. </strong><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">Consistently catch your student doing good work and make a big deal out of it.
            Help identify what your student does well and highlight that strength as much as possible. It is not a
            way to give praise, but to describe what your student did correctly.</span></li>
</ul>

            </li>
            <li><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I can read your print so well. How did you learn to print so
