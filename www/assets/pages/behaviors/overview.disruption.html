Disruptive behaviors are among the greatest challenges teachers face. These behaviors negatively affect teacher job satisfaction and contribute to teacher shortages found in many school districts. Often, these disruptions can dramatically affect the welfare of everyone involved. When educators are slow to respond, the disruptive student seizes the opportunity to hold the classroom hostage. Spending time and energy trying to cure the disruptive student, unfairly disregards the needs of the other students and often jeopardizes other student’s right to learn in a safe environment. When endless effort and attention given to the offending student produces little results, teachers become burnt out and cynical.

Instead, consider giving continued support to the disruptive student while also setting healthy limits. That is, allow students to remain with the class as long as they can do so without creating a problem. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary for the teacher to sharing share control with students.  Teachers master authority in their classroom by providing choices and asking questions. Remember that students do not get a vote on almost anything that happens throughout their day.  As educators, you are the  guide and have the ultimate say. However, creating an environment where students enjoy plenty of opportunities to make decisions and experience the positive and negative consequences of each decision fosters cooperation.

Provide choices within limits primarily as a preventative measure - Most educators might find it difficult to provide effective choices in the face of a disruption. During these times, our brains tend to go into fight or flight mode. As such, the only choices that come to mind are threats. “Settle down or go to the principal's office!” Thinking of choices usually requires a calm mind. For a teacher, that is usually when she/he is experiencing a high level of cooperation. That is the time to offer two options that are equally acceptable.
