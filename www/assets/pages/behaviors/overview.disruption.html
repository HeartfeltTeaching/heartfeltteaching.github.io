<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disruptive behaviors are among the greatest challenges teachers face. These behaviors
        negatively affect teacher job satisfaction and contribute to teacher shortages found in many school districts.
        Often, these disruptions can dramatically affect the welfare of everyone involved. When educators are slow to
        respond, the disruptive student seizes the opportunity to hold the classroom hostage. Spending time and energy
        trying to cure the disruptive student, unfairly disregards the needs of the other students and often jeopardizes
        other student's right to learn in a safe environment. When endless effort and attention given to the offending
        student produces little results,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teachers become burnt out and
        cynical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, consider giving continued support to the disruptive student while also
        setting healthy limits. That is, allow students to remain with the class as long as they can do so without
        creating a problem. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary for the teacher to sharing share control with
        students. This approach is child-centred rather than teacher-centered and has been not only confirmed to be
        beneficial, but vital to development. Teachers can master their authority in the classroom by providing choices
        and asking questions. Remember that students do not get a vote on almost anything that happens throughout their
        day. You are the guide and have the ultimate say. However, creating an environment where students enjoy plenty
        of opportunities to make decisions and experience the positive and negative consequences of each decision
        fosters cooperation. </span></p>
