In the classroom, teachers are bound to come across student conflict- it is unavoidable! A big conflict can begin small, for example, actions such as student using another studentâ€™s property without permission or unprovoked contact can lead to major conflict. This indicates that few initial contracts are predatory, but conflict escalates rapidly. When conflicts are challenging, they may seem impossible to resolve or it may make you not want to deal with it at all. Ignoring student conflict may seem effective in the moment, but in the long run, the problem is not being dealt with in a healthy way. Giving students some simple problem-solving tools can help them work through peer conflict before they interfere with academics and lead to bigger social-emotional challenges. In other instances, it may be necessary to explain to students you will be taking charge of the situation and explain that consequences will take place. Issues that occur on day-to-day basis with students are more effectively handled when teachers have the freedom to decide what course of action will most effectively meet the unique needs of the student(s) involved.
