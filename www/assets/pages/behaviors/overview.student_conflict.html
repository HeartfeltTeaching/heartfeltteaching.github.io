<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conflict is nearly unavoidable in the classroom! Afterall, it is part of a
        child's learning experience. A small conflict can easily escalate into a large scale clash. An example of
        some triggers include, students who use another student's property without permission or unprovoked
        contact leading to major conflict. When conflicts are challenging, they may seem impossible to resolve or it may
        make you not want to deal with it at all. Ignoring student conflict may seem effective in the moment, but in the
        long run, the problem is not being dealt with in a healthy way. Giving students some simple problem-solving
        tools can help them work through peer conflict before it interferes with learning. Guiding the conflict by
        asking questions will generate thinking to consider respectful ways to solve their conflict. In other instances,
        it may be necessary to explain to students you will be taking charge of the situation and explain that
        consequences will take place. Issues that occur on day-to-day basis with students are more effectively handled
        when teachers have the freedom to decide what course of action will most effectively meet the unique needs of
        the student(s) involved. </span></p>
