<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conflict in the classroom is nearly inevitable . After all, handling disagreements
        it is part of a child's learning experience. However, small tensions can sometimes escalate into large 
        scale clashes that can be difficult to handle. Examples of commom triggers include, students who use another 
        student's property without permission, wisecracks or insults, or unprovoked contact leading to anger getting 
        out of control. These conflicts are challenging to diffuse. Although it may be tempting to think these issues 
        will resolve on their own, ignoring the conflict risks intensifying into a chaotic situation. Teaching students 
        some simple problem-solving skills can help them work through peer conflict before it interferes with learning and
        will have a lasting impact in their relationships. First, guide the conflict by asking questions. This will generate 
        thinking to consider respectful ways to solve their conflict. Second, ask the students how they think the matter could 
        be sovled. Most children will come up with ideas on their own. In some instances though, it may be 
        necessary to explain to the students that you will be taking charge of the situation and that
        consequences will take place. Issues that occur on day-to-day basis with students are more effectively handled
        when teachers have the freedom to decide what course of action will most effectively meet the unique needs of
        the student(s) involved. </span></p>
