                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Empathy</strong> - This approach encourages educators to pick
                                empathetic statements that feel natural to them and that can be used every time.
                                Examples of empathetic
                                statements include, "Oh, no. I bet that feels terrible" and "I can't imagine how bad
                                that feels." Empathy is
                                demonstrated when the teacher shows understanding not only for the child's feelings but
                                for the way in which
                                they see the word (Fay and Fay, 2016). A consequence for early-stage misbehavior
                                delivered with empathy and
                                without emotion will give the student information about the offense and is more likely
                                to be corrected
                                (Williams, 2010). </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Neutralizing Student Arguing</strong> - according to this
                                approach, students
                                often use arguing, whining, and complaining to avoid consequences (Fay, 2006). If the
                                consequences of this
                                behavior results in ejection from the classroom, the student has succeeded in his
                                original intent of avoiding
                                the work. If the student does not get the desired result through complaints or whining,
                                they might try to
                                provoke the teacher by drawing a line in the sand and picking a fight (Shukla-Mehta
                                &amp; Albin, 2003). A Love
                                and Logic strategy encourages teachers to maintain their leadership by simply going
                                "brain dead" and using a
                                rehearsed one-liner, like: "I care too much to argue" (Fay, 2006). Using a one-liner to
                                neutralize arguments
                                should always demonstrate true caring and compassion.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Using Choices to Prevent Power Struggles</strong> - This
                                fundamental
                                principle of Love and Logic provides a healthy balance between providing limits and
                                foster a sense of caring.
                                This practice places emphasis on providing students with multiple opportunities to make
                                small choices. As a
                                result, in time, students become experts in decision making (Fay &amp; Fay,
                                2016).</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Guiding Students to Solve Their Own Problems</strong> - Love
                                and Logic
                                emphasizes the importance of teaching children to develop problem-solving skills by
                                requiring them to think
                                through their problems. When young people are guided through the problem-solving
                                process, they are given
                                opportunities to practice identifying and defining the problem, pondering solutions,
                                considering the
                                consequences of each, and making decisions. (Gresham, Bao, Van, &amp; Cook, 2006).

                                Love and Logic
                                educator training program is designed to improve teacher-student relationships. Hamre,
                                Bridget, and Pianta
                                (2005) found that students who were at risk of school failure may be moderated by
                                support from teachers (Hamre
                                et al., 2005). Love and Logic's focus is centered around building positive relationships
                                with students.
