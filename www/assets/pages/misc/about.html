<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when education&rsquo;sprominent role in the United States is flourishing, so are the failing grades and lack of confidence in our schools. As teacher demandsincrease, so does their sense that they are not being supported. Legislative demands for teachers to deliver proficient levels on state standards can cause a heavy burden for teachers.Challenging classroom environments resulting from discipline problems and a lack of support in dealing with repeated daily disruptions are a contributing factor to high stress and burnout rates. Although schools are beginning to implement social and emotional programs and train their staff to replace exclusionary discipline strategies like punishment with training of replacement behaviors, teachers still report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies. We created this practical online tool to provide teachers with prompt solutions and strategies for those classroom behaviors that halt learning and frustrate teachers. We are school psychologists who utilize Love and Logic Essential Skills for the Classroom when collaborating and supporting teachers in our schools. We wanted to build a resource to help solidify skills learned in Love and Logic teacher trainings and support all teachers in implementing a positive classroom environment. It is our intent that this application will assist teachers who need quick answers to the daily challenges they face. Included in this resource are video clips from a 15-year Love and Logic facilitator/trainer and experienced school psychologist that address behaviors ranging from arguing/complaining, and how to handle student conflict, to disrespect and aggression. </span></p>
