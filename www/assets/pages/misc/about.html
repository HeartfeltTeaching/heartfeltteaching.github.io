        At a time when education's prominent role in the United
        States is flourishing, so are the failing grades and lack of confidence in our schools. As teacher demands
        increase, so does their sense that they are not being supported. Legislative demands for teachers to deliver
        proficient levels on state standards can cause a heavy burden for teachers.Challenging classroom environments
        resulting from discipline problems and a lack of support in dealing with repeated daily disruptions are a
        contributing factor to high stress and burnout rates. Although schools are beginning to implement social and
        emotional programs and train their staff to replace exclusionary discipline strategies like punishment with
        training of replacement behaviors, teachers still report a lack of support in implementing classroom management
        strategies. We created this practical online tool to provide teachers with prompt solutions and strategies for
        those classroom behaviors that halt learning and frustrate teachers. We are school psychologists in training who
        utilize Love and Logic Essential Skills for the Classroom when collaborating and supporting teachers in our
        schools.
        We wanted to build a resource to help solidify skills learned in Love and Logic teacher trainings and support
        all teachers in implementing a positive classroom environment. It is our intent that this application will
        assist teachers who need quick answers to the daily challenges they face. Included in this resource are video
        clips
        from a 15-year Love and Logic facilitator/trainer Kristen Baisden who is an experienced school psychologist
        and our collaborator, inspiration, and mentor. These videos address behaviors ranging from arguing/complaining,
        and how to handle student conflict, to disrespect and aggression.
        We also want to acknowledge our professor Meagan O'Malley who patiently supported us and saw what was possible.
        Lastly, this project would not be realized
        without the
        steadfast effort of our web-app developer Mr. Ivan Mihov.
