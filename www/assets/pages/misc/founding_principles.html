                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love and Logic (LL) is a positive behavioral research-based approach
                                that was first
                                established through the publications of </span><em><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">Parenting with Love and Logic
                                </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cine &amp; Fay, 1990), and </span><em><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">Parenting Teens with Love and Logic</span></em><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">(Cline &amp; Fay, 1992), and </span><em><span
                                        style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching with
                                        Love and Logic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Fay &amp; Funk,
                                1995). LL developers, Foster W.
                                Cline and Charles Fay, wanted to focus on merging theory and practice and developed a
                                set of useful and
                                effective tools for helping support the emotional and behavioral well-being of children
                                and thereby reducing
                                educator stress levels.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LL integrates various theoretical core principles (e.g., Behavioral
                                Theory,
                                Resilience Theories, Social Learning Theory, and Cognitive and Attribution Theories).
                                Those principles are
                                centered on shared dignity and respect, shared thinking and problems solving, shared
                                control within limits,
                                sincere empathy, and positive adult-child relationships. This framework is designed to
                                assist with effective
                                decision making and teach consequences. Instead of relying on external motivators to
                                influence behaviors, this
                                behavior approach is based on the understanding that behavior is governed by a positive
                                relationship with a
                                significant adult.</span></p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Principle One: </strong></span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain Mutual Dignity and Respect - Educators must
                                demonstrate respect toward
                                students while maintaining disciplinary interventions </span></p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Principle Two: </strong></span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Sincere Empathy- Educators communicate a strong dose of
                                genuine understanding and
                                compassion prior to expecting students to solve the problems they create. </span></p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Principle Three: </strong></span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Shared Thinking- Educators guide their students to solve the
                                problems they create
                                individually</span></p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Principle Four: </strong></span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400;">Shared Control Within Limits- Educators allow their students
                                to decide the smaller
                                things that do not affect the welfare of others in the classroom. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Principle
                                                Five:</strong></span>Healthy Relationships- Intervention is focused on
                                building and maintaining a
                                relationship with students</span></p>
